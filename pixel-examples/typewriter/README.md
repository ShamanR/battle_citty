# Typewriter

This example demonstrates text drawing and text input facilities by implementing a fancy typewriter
with a red laser cursor. Screen shakes a bit when typing and some letters turn bold or italic
randomly.

ASCII and Latin characters are supported here. Feel free to add support for more characters in the
code (it's easy, but increases load time).

The seemingly buggy letters (one over another) in the screenshot are not bugs, but a result of using
the typewriter backspace functionality.
