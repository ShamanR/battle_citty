# Lights

This example demonstrates powerful Porter-Duff composition used to create a nice noisy light effect.

**Use W and S keys** to adjust the level of "dust".

The FPS is limited to 30, because the effect is a little expensive and my computer couldn't handle
60 FPS. If you have a more powerful computer (which is quite likely), peek into the code and disable
the limit.
